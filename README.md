​Hello Toliss simmers I think I have a real treat to you.
I was always missing 1 thing when flying Toliss after ditching msfs and Fenix. It was a boarding process that it had on its EFB. 
I'm glad to bring you the boarding functionality from the Fenix efb in the form of Lua script that is compatible with every Toliss  



DESCRIPTION:
It adds an tab to FlightWithLua Macros tab, that when opened presents you with an window that lets you:
	- Select a passenger number that you want to board/deboard.
	
	- Select that number randomly (it's not just 0 - 100 random generator, I put some scaling 		into this random values in order for them to reflect passenger 	numbers much better).
	
	- Import your passenger number from current simbrief flightplan!!!
	
	- Choose speed of the boarding (Real, Fast and Instant).
	
	- Start boarding/deboarding.
	- Edit script settings such as:
​​​​​​​		- Setting your Simbrief username
		- Turning on option that simulates some passengers not showing up after simbrief 		import
		- Using front and back door for boarding / deboarding in addition to front door. 		(default is front door only)

In addition to that it automatically:

	- Randomizes (also smartly randomize) the passenger distribution so it won't be always the 	same which will result in different trim values every flight!
	
	- Opens passenger/cargo doors when boarding is started and closes them after its finished.
	- Adjusts payload of the aircraft to match the boarding status.

After you start boarding/deboarding process you can close the window (the process will run in background) and you can follow the progress of boarding/deboarding by hovering over the bottom left side of the screen.

After the boarding/deboarding will finish the application window will show itself, and boarding chime will ring informing you that boarding has completed.



INSTALLATION:

1. Install current version of FlyWithLua NG+, if you don't have it already.

2. Extract the zip in the "<X-Plane-Folder>/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/" folder. Be sure that you have all the needed files  in the MODULE folder because there are essential for the script to work.

3. Enjoy!!!

It should be compatible with every Toliss version. I hope you like it, it's my first Lua script, whole day of work went into it, and I'm happy with the result.
